# Api for the Noted

## Introduction to Noted
Noted was an edutech startup that made products for college students to help study for their exams for free.
We worked on it for over 3 years and helped over 10,000 students with it. Now that the startup is 
shut we decided to open source it in hope of inspiring someone else.

## Project details
Creator Studio was an internal software we used to make revision notes optimised for mobile screens.
I used [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as the framework. [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for state management. Styling was done with [material.ui](http://www.material-ui.com/)
